üëã Hello, my name is pronounced as `/Yeo-un/`. I also go by `Rachel` so feel free to call me either.

I am a first year <b>Ph.D. student at Syracuse University</b>. Before joining Syracuse University, I got a Masters from [Yonsei University](https://digitalanalytics.yonsei.ac.kr/digital_analytics/index.do).

My research interest is mainly in <b>Natural Language Processing(NLP)</b>, specifically <b>extracting information</b> using NLP tools and deep learning. Text holds a lot of information that have yet been discovered and I believe making use of such is an important task. 

Another interest I have is <b>Information Retrieval</b> especially cross-modal retrieval. In my Masters, my colleagues and I worked on a <b>cross-modal retrieval model</b> that preserves the temporal order within videos.

Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JYrO_FYAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao) or [CV](https://yuheunk.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_yk_2209.pdf) for more information. <br>
