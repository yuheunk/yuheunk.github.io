üëã Hello, my name is pronounced as `/Yeo-un/`. I also go by `Rachel` so feel free to call me either. 

My research interest is mainly in <b>Natural Language Processing(NLP)</b>, specifically <b>information extraction</b> using NLP tools and deep learning.

I got a M.S. in [Digital Analytics](https://digitalanalytics.yonsei.ac.kr/digital_analytics/index.do) from Yonsei University and worked as a research assistant in [Deep Text Lab](https://deeptext.yonsei.ac.kr) on various NLP tasks such as <i>Biomedical Information Extraction, Social Text Mining</i> and <i>Neural Search</i>.

Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JYrO_FYAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao) or [CV](https://yuheunk.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_yk_2401.pdf) for more information. <br>
